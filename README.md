# react-native-audio-pro

A minimalist and opinionated audio player for React Native, written in TypeScript, with a focus on high audio quality and simple integration.

This is a fork of [react-native-track-player](https://github.com/DoubleSymmetry/react-native-track-player), refined to provide core audio playback functionality using modern standards. We've removed deprecated features and support for older technologies to keep the library lightweight and easy to integrate.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-native-audio-pro
```
or
```bash
yarn add react-native-audio-pro
```

## Usage

```tsx
// TODO: Add usage examples here
```
